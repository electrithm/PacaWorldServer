**CONTRIBUTING**

Feel free to contribute, just dont break anything or screw up the project.

**CONVENTIONS**

I know I don't exactly write the cleanest code, but I don't want people to write ugly spaghetti code just because my code isn't the cleanest. If you are going to add to the code, make it neat and leave comments so other people can know what you did without having to piece through the code.

**FEATURES**

To keep things simple, I have a list of features that I want to be added to the software. If you have an idea but it isn't on the list, ask me if it can be added to the list.
